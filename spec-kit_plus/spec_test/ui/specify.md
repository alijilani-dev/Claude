   formatted tables for operation history.
2. Interaction: Implement arrow-key selection for operations (Addition, 
   Subtraction, etc.) using 'Inquirer' or 'Questionary' instead of manual text input.
3. Visuals: Use a distinct color palette (e.g., Cyan for prompts, Green for 
   results, Red for errors).
4. Layout: Include a header section showing the "Panaversity Calculator v2.0" 
   title using a stylized border.
5. Context: Maintain the core logic established in
