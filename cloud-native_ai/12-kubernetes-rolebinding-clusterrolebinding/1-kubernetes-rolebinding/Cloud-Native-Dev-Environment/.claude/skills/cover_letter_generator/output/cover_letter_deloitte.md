**Subject:** Consultant-Gen AI – Delivering Production-Ready Agentic AI Solutions Across Industries

Dear Deloitte AI & Data Talent Team,

**[PROBLEM]** Deloitte's AI & Data practice is at the forefront of helping enterprises transition from AI experimentation to production-grade deployment. Organizations across sectors struggle with a critical bottleneck: they have access to powerful LLM models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Bedrock, yet lack the architectural expertise to implement RAG pipelines and agentic workflows that deliver measurable business ROI. The gap between a promising AI prototype and a scalable, compliant enterprise solution requires consultants who understand both the cutting-edge technology and the practical realities of regulated industries.

**[SOLUTION]** I specialize in bridging exactly this gap. As a Project Manager & Agentic AI Developer with 18+ years of multidisciplinary IT experience, I bring hands-on expertise with Claude Code, Python, and NLP, combined with practical agentic workflow implementation using n8n and Make.com. My approach centers on Responsible AI—I prioritize explainability and "The Translation Layer," having spent years presenting complex technical implementations to non-technical executive leadership across fintech, telecom, and international trade sectors. At ARY Speed Remit, I re-engineered web portals to meet KYC/AML compliance requirements, demonstrating my ability to deliver AI-adjacent solutions in heavily regulated environments. My DevOps foundation (AWS EC2, RDS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines) ensures that the Gen AI solutions I architect don't just work in development—they scale reliably in production. I stay current with transformer architectures, diffusion models, and the latest research from arXiv, ensuring my recommendations reflect today's best practices, not last year's patterns.

**[IMPACT]** This methodology has produced quantifiable results: I built and maintained trading platforms serving 500+ international traders with users spanning 250+ from the UK and 175+ from Germany, requiring robust scalability and security. My Document Management System implementations at WorkPlains featured enterprise-grade capabilities including document classification, version control, and secure WebDAV integration—the same architectural thinking required for vector database implementations and RAG pipelines. Across my career spanning Ireland, UAE, and Pakistan, I've delivered AI and software solutions in telecom, fintech, education, and logistics—the cross-industry experience that Deloitte's diverse client portfolio demands. I am eager to bring this combination of technical depth, consulting acumen, and proven delivery capability to the Gen AI Consultant role, helping Deloitte's clients realize immediate ROI from their AI investments.

Best regards,
