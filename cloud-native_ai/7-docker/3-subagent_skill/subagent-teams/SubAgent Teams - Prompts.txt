Prompt 1: 
Prompt Generation for Gemini Nano Banana:

Attachment: parallel-sessions-and-subagent-delegation.md
Path: D:\Ali_Home\Learning\AgenticAI\AI-P009\claude_projects\skills\subagent-teams\documentation

Prompt 2:
Gemini Nano Banana image generation Prompt:

Instruction: Use the imgGenTool (Nano Banana) to create a professional, high-resolution isometric 3D tech infographic illustrating the Subagent Delegation Framework in a powerful isometric infographic image titled "SubAgent-Teams" for Claude Code.

Layout & Structure:

Central Hub: A sleek, glowing central node representing the Main Orchestrator (Claude Sonnet/Opus).

Branching Tasks: Four floating, semi-transparent isometric "workstations" (subagents) connected to the hub by glowing data streams.

Subagent Workstations:

Explore Agent: Visualized with a magnifying glass icon, researching a 3D file folder structure.

Pattern Agent: Visualized with a network node icon, analyzing code patterns.

Test Agent: Visualized with a green checkmark/shield icon, running parallel test executions.

Synthesize Agent: Visualized with a funnel icon, returning a compact summary to the hub.

Visual Style & Details:

Aesthetic: "Corporate Memphis" meets "Cyberpunk" with a clean, futuristic glassmorphism feel.

Color Palette: Deep navy background with vibrant teal, neon blue, and electric purple accents for active data paths.

Key Comparison Sidebar: Include a small side panel showing "Without Subagents" (a single overflowing trash can of data) vs. "With Subagents" (organized, sleek modular blocks).

Text/Labels: Use crisp sans-serif typography for labels: "Lean Context," "Isolated Sessions," and "Parallel Execution".

Technical Requirements: Landscape 16:9 aspect ratio, 4K rendering quality, and technical schematic line art for a professional engineering "vibe".
