Prompt 2:
Gemini Nano Banana image generation Prompt:

Instruction: Use the imgGenTool to create a professional isometric 3D tech infographic titled "Docker-Hub-Toolkit" that illustrates a production-grade containerization pipeline.

Layout & Structure:

Central Workflow: A multi-layered vertical stack representing the 4-Stage Dockerfile (Base → Builder → Dev → Production).

Data Streams: Glowing digital pathways connecting the local terminal to a floating Docker Hub cloud icon.

Key Module Nodes:

Security Hub: A shield icon labeled "Security Best Practices" with a magnifying glass scanning for vulnerabilities.

Pipeline Station: A conveyor belt icon labeled "CI/CD Pipeline" showing a GitHub Actions logo pushing modular blocks.

Optimization Engine: A lightning bolt icon labeled "BuildKit Cache" showing speed lines between layers.

Validation Gate: A 10-point checklist icon labeled "10-Point Quality Gate".

Visual Style & Details:

Aesthetic: Clean, futuristic "Glassmorphism" with technical blueprint line-art overlaying the 3D objects.

Color Palette: Deep navy and charcoal background with "Docker Blue" (#2496ED), neon teal, and electric purple accents for the data streams.

Callouts: Use crisp sans-serif labels for "python:3.12-slim," "Multi-platform Buildx," and "Non-root User".

Comparison Sidebar: A small "Before vs. After" panel:

Before: A single, large, heavy red block labeled "1GB Legacy Image".

After: Four small, efficient blue blocks labeled "150MB Optimized Image".

Technical Requirements: 16:9 Landscape aspect ratio, 4K rendering quality, emphasizing depth and modularity to represent a "production-grade" engineering tool.

*Lecture 8 - Assignment: Docker Hub Toolkit*

Check out SubAgent-Teams repo here: https://github.com/alijilani-dev/Claude/tree/main/skills/docker-hub-toolkit

Give it a star ⭐ and let me know if it speeds up your Docker-Hub workflow!

A production-grade skill that automates the entire Python project containerization and deployment pipeline!

*Features:* 
* 4-Stage Builds:* Automatically generates optimized Dockerfiles (Base → Builder → Dev → Production). 
* Extreme Optimization:* Shrinks Python images from ~1GB to ~150MB using python:3.12-slim. 
* Fast Rebuilds:* Implements BuildKit cache mounts so you aren't waiting forever for pip install. 
* CI/CD Ready:* Sets up GitHub Actions with Docker Scout security scanning and multi-platform support. 
* 10-Point Quality Gate:* Includes a validation script to ensure your containers follow every security best practice (score 88/100).

Instead of manually writing Dockerfiles and troubleshooting DockerHub Actions, just ask the Agent: "Containerize my FastAPI app and push it to Docker Hub", and it handles the rest.

Containerizing Python applications is often a trade-off between speed, size, and security. Most developers settle for "good enough" Dockerfiles that slow down CI/CD pipelines and increase the attack surface. 

We’ve built the Docker Hub Toolkit, a production-grade skill for Claude Code designed to automate the heavy lifting of end-to-end Docker deployment with industry-best practices baked in.

What makes this toolkit a game-changer?
Extreme Image Optimization: Automatically generates 4-stage Dockerfiles that shrink Python images from ~1GB to ~150MB using python:3.12-slim.

Lightning-Fast Rebuilds: Implements BuildKit cache mounts (--mount=type=cache) so your dependency installation doesn't restart from scratch every time you change a line of code.

The 10-Point Quality Gate: Includes an automated validation script that checks for non-root users, secret leaks, and layer ordering before you ever push to the hub.

CI/CD on Autopilot: Generates complete Docker Hub Actions workflows featuring Docker Scout vulnerability scanning and multi-platform (amd64/arm64) support.

Production-Ready by Default
This isn't just about writing a file; it's about a standardized engineering workflow:

Generate optimized multi-stage builds.

Validate against security best practices.

Build & Tag using semantic versioning and Git SHAs.

Secure via Docker Scout scanning.

Deploy with integrated GitHub Actions templates.

Why use a Claude Skill for this?
Instead of manually managing .dockerignore files or troubleshooting cross-platform buildx errors, you can now delegate the entire containerization strategy to Claude. It ensures consistency across your team and eliminates the "it worked on my machine" Docker headache.
