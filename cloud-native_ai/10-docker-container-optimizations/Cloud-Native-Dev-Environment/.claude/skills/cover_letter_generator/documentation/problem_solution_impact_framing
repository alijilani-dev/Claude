The most effective method for creating cover letter for AI Job on LinkedIn is the "Problem-Solution-Impact" (PSI) Framing.

In the AI sector, this is often refined into the Technical-Value Alignment method. Instead of listing skills, you identify a specific technical bottleneck mentioned in the job description (the Problem), describe the specific architecture or model you would use to fix it (the Solution), and quantify the resulting business efficiency or accuracy gain (the Impact).
