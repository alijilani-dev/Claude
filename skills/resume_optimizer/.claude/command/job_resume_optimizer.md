Create a skill called "linkedin_job_resume_optimizer" with the following strengths

Initialize a job search and resume tailoring workflow:

1. Use 'playwright' to search for 2 remote AI-related job postings on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/jobs) that match the skills found in 'D:\Ali_Home\Learning\AgenticAI\AI-P009\claude_projects\skills\docx\resume.docx'.
2. For each job found
   - Share link to the exact job on linkedin.
   - Extract the full job description.
   - Use 'docx' to read the base resume at 'D:\Ali_Home\Learning\AgenticAI\AI-P009\claude_projects\skills\docx\resume.docx'.
   - Generate a new, ATS-optimized .docx resume tailored specifically to that job's keywords and requirements. Save these as 'resume_tailored_[job_title].docx'.
3. Perform a Gap Analysis:
   - Identify skill gaps between the base resume and the job requirements.
   - For each gap, suggest 10 targeted interview preparation questions.
   - Provide specific LinkedIn 'About' and 'Skills' section updates to address these missing keywords.
4. Finalize by summarizing the 2 jobs found and the location of the newly generated resumes.
