Step 1: As part of my study, I first give a title to the AI Agent and ask it to create study notes with clear sections and key concepts.

Step 2: I then ask the AI Agent to simplify the notes into concise summaries for quick revision.

Step 3: Next, I ask the AI Agent to identify key terms, definitions, and important facts from the notes.

Step 4: I then ask the AI Agent to create flashcards to reinforce my learning.

Step 5: Finally, I ask the AI Agent to create a quiz for me to attempt.


Implementation:

 

Step 1: Defining rules.


Step 1:
All notes created should be in notes directory and flashcards should be present in directory named as "flashcards" and quizes will be in "quizes" 
directory, so that we have properly organized everything.

or

all notes created should be in notes directory and flashcards should be present in directory named as "flashcards" and quizes will be in "quizes" directory, so that we have proper organized every thing. similarly, all notes summaries should be in "notes-summary" named directory and facts related to notes should be in directory named "notes-facts" Respective folders created for study material.
  
Step 2: 
generate a skill that will create other claude code skills for me using claude code docs standards for consistency across all skills. This skill should be named as "skill-maker" and user will give their prompt what type of skill they want to generate and "skill-maker" will generate and if there are any gaps in the concept covered in user's prompt, "skill-maker" must ask question to user before generating new skills to ensure quality standards.

Step 3:
use @claude\skills\skill-maker\ skill, generate a new skill name as "notes-generator" and it will generate notes based on topic title or reference file if    
 provided, notes that it creates should follow the methodology of bloom taxonomy
